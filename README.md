# Wealth and Life Expectancy

## Background and Objective

Hans Rosling is one of the most popular data scientists on the web. His original TED talk, [The best stats youâ€™ve ever seen](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) set a new bar for data visualization.

- Setup: I imported the libraries dyplyr and ggplot2 and the data gapminder as 'gap'.
- Data Wrangling: I filtered the data to exclude the country Kuwait because it was corrupted data.
- Data Visualization: I used color and scale to create a comprehensive plot that explores the relationship between GDP per capita (yaxis) and Life Expectancy(xaxis). The visualizations are sorted by every 4 years from 1952-2007. Each point represents a country from the data set. The size of each point shows the population of the country and the color shows what continent that country is in which is shown on the legend.
- Observe relationships between variables based on the visualization
